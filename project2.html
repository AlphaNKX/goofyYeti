		<h2>Life's A Game!</h2>
		<ol>
		<li> What is the idea that you have for your app? <b> A fitness tracker that turns real-life progress into game stats. </b> </li> 
		<br>
		<li> What part is 2D and what part is 3D? <b> The hud and layout of the app, shop, avatar, etc. 3D would be AR, a form of tracking or camera augmentation. </b> </li>
		<br>
		<li> What is your original, simple, hypothesis about this app? <b> It will help to motivate those who are young or looking to work out and get entertainment. </b> </li>
		<br>
		<li> Why is this idea important or needed in the world? <b> Health and well-being support options are always in demand. </b> </li>
		<br>
		<li> How do you plan to use XR emotionally to immerse the user in the experience? <b> The extended reality adds a layer of immersion for the user by incorporating real world elements into the game. </b> </li>
		<br>
		<li> 3 reasons why this idea is good for XR. 
		<ul> i.   Good because easily adaptable  </ul> 
		<ul> ii.  Good because XR is prominent in the gaming industry already so there's a lot of source material. </ul> 
		<ul> iii. Good because it XR allows for real life activity to be implemented into the game </ul> </li>
		<br>
		<li>3 Reasons why this idea is better in 3D.
		<ul> i.   Because this idea involves a digital avatar in real world places.  </ul> 
		<ul> ii.  We live in 3D spaces and the app tracks activity and distance. </ul> 
		<ul> iii. 3D would increase the immersion of the app. </ul> </li>
		<br>
		<li> In what way is each of AR, MR and VR possibly useful for the project? <b> AR and MR could be used to project in game avatars in real spaces, blending game with reality. VR could create more exciting environments for users to play in </b> </li>
		<br>
		<li> Auditing your idea
		<ul> i.   Does your idea exist in 2D? No, only similar aspects never fully encompassing   </ul> 
		<ul> ii.  Does your idea exist in 3D?  No, only similar aspects never fully encompassing </ul> 
		<ul> iii. What could you do in your project in 3D that you can't do in 2D? First-person Combat, AR, or VR</ul> </li>
		<br>
		<li> Hypothesized design principles
		<ul> <b> Useful </b> - Motivation for daily exercise  </ul> 
		<ul> <b> Usable </b> - User friendly UI provides easy navigation of the app for daily use. </ul> 
		<ul> <b> Desirable </b> - Getting exercise to progress in the game and in your physical wellbeing.</ul> 
		<ul> <b> Valuable </b> - Makes being active enjoyable and easy to access </ul> 
		<ul> <b> Findable </b> - How much you’ve walked and how active you’ve been to track progress towards health goals. </ul> 
		<ul> <b> Accessible </b> and Inclusive - Those with physical disabilities can still get active and enjoy the game, the app will track distance not body movement to be more inclusive of those who need assistance devices like wheelchairs or crutches.   </ul>

		<h3> User Stories: </h3>
		<p>Haares is a 19 year old student at KPU. He enjoys video games and hanging out with friends, but recently Haares’s lifestyle has become extremely unhealthy. After losing <br> 
		his job Haares has put on weight, and has become very lethargic and depressed. His friends recommend he starts working out but he struggles with sticking to any workout plan they give him.
		<br>
		<br>
		Hayden is a 22 year old who struggles to find his work-life balance. He’s often tired from work and lacks motivation to do anything but eat junk food and watch TV. His parents <br> 
		urged him to do something about his health. He tries to exercise for a week but not knowing how to, he injures himself and gives up.  
		</p>
		
		<h3> User Needs: </h3>
		<p>Users who might be hard of hearing or like to have music on might miss notifications, so to solve this problem, we have incorporated a settings menu to adjust the different sounds and volumes. <br>
		 Also, our users might be playing late at night and not want loud sounds bothering them while they play, making the settings a genuinely irreplaceable asset.
		<br>
		<br>
		Users who are gamers like our clients often like to spend money or show off by buying in-game materials with real money, so we have added a shop so that they can spend it. Speaking of showing off, <br>
		people will need friends to show off too. That's why we also have friends like and chat so all our lovely users can share their experiences together. 
		<br>
		<br>
		A lot of our users might lack motivation, preferring short-term returns, which is why leveling and equipment with small-step goals will allow them to push for long-term benefits, ultimately solving <br>
		the problem without skipping the hard work.
